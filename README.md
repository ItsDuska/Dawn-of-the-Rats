# Dawn-of-the-Rats
Fun little platformer game about collecting five spinning rats. Now with 100% spaghetti code!!!!

Made by me and few of my friends.

This project started as a fun little experiment with pygame, but evolved into something else. In the current version of the game, I'm starting to experience performance issues, probably due to my bad code, so I'm trying to move this project to C++. Currently I have been using python 3.11 with pygame, but due to my slow code I would need a faster language. So I chose C++ with the SFML library, which I've used a bit.
