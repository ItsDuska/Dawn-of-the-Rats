# Dawn-of-the-Rats
Fun little platformer game about collecting five spinning rats. Now with 100% spaghetti code!!!!

Made by me and few of my friends.

This project started as a fun little experiment with pygame, but evolved into something else. In the current version of the game, I'm starting to experience performance issues, probably due to my bad code, so I'm trying to move this project to C++. Currently I have been using python 3.11 with pygame, but due to my slow code I would need a faster language. So I chose C++ with the SFML library, which I've used a bit.


Update:

The basic idea of the game has changed from a small platformer with few levels and few bosses to a game that resembles Noita. So randomly generated caves / dungeons with monsters and treasures. The main objective is to get to the bottom of the cave system and defeat the evil rat boss. The logic of the game may be simple, but the goal is to get a big score and try to get to the bottom as quickly as possible. (basically a speedrun, but no)

Current progress:
Chunk generation works for the first few chunks and the textures are temporary. Many things will change, but for now these are just for testing.
