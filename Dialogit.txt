panic panic panic!
I've lost my rats!! 
Someone call the ambulance, I think I'm having a heart attack!
Oh wait a minute.
We're in the medieval time, damn it!
Oh, I didn't see you there youngster.
Well... hehe...
I'm in a small pickle here so....
Could you please be a nice human and go find all five of my rats.
If you do, I would reward you with something nice.
Now then, if I remember right the rats went to East.
