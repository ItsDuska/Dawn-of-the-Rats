# Dawn-of-the-Rats
Dawn of the Rats is a game inspired by Noita. At the moment, the main idea of ​​the game is unknown, because I'm just making something that I enjoy and that looks cool. The game is made with 100% spaghetti code!!!!

This project started as a fun little experiment with pygame, but evolved into something else. In the current version of the python version, I'm experiencing performance issues, probably due to my bad code, so I'm trying to move this project to C++. Currently I have been using python 3.11 with pygame, but due to my slow code I needed a faster language. So I chose C++ with the SFML library, which I've used a bit.


Update:

The basic idea of the game has changed from a small platformer with few levels and few bosses to a game that resembles Noita. So randomly generated caves / dungeons with monsters and treasures. The main objective is to get to the bottom of the cave system and defeat the evil rat boss. The logic of the game may be simple, but the goal is to get a big score and try to get to the bottom as quickly as possible. (basically a speedrun, but no)

This is what the game looks like at the moment. Progress is slow but I'm enjoying this.
